# bm_rpi
baremetal assembler on raspi B
A super basic os, if it can even be called that, writen for the rasberry pi B in assembler
based largely on Alex Chadwick's excellent turorial: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/index.html

As of yet it really doesnt do much other than blink an led using an interupt, display some text
and display a picture. 

Be warned: The code is probably of poor quality and the comments probably more so. Ive tried to
explain what the various bits and pieces do but but how well is debateable!!! ;)
